My attempt to implement Lox using Rust as I go through [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

So far I've done the lexer and a parser.

Note: I didn't know it at the time, but some cool people like [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNOLaw-_Buc&list=PLqbS7AVVErFhAhQ5s9SWcvxHh4GwsIk_d&index=8) have also implemented [this](https://github.com/jonhoo/lox).
