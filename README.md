My attempt to implement Lox using Rust as I go through [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

So far I've done the lexer and a parser.

Note: I didn't know it at the time, but some cool people like [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNOLaw-_Buc&list=PLqbS7AVVErFhAhQ5s9SWcvxHh4GwsIk_d&index=8) have also implemented [this](https://github.com/jonhoo/lox).
While I'm mainly reading the book and write things as I go, I'm sure he's done much of a better job at having an idiomatic code. I'll come back to his code for reference later and might change my design. My priority so far has been just tinkering with the compiler aspect, not whether I'm writing good Rust or not.
